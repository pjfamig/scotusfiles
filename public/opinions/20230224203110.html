Detroit Timber &amp;amp; Lumber Co., 200 U. S. 321, 337.&lt;/p&gt;<br>	&lt;h2&gt;SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES&lt;/h2&gt;<br>	&lt;h2&gt;Syllabus&lt;/h2&gt;<br>	&lt;h3&gt;BARTENWERFER v. BUCKLEY&lt;/h3&gt;<br>	&lt;p&gt;CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT&lt;/p&gt;<br>	&lt;p&gt;No. 21–908. Argued December 6, 2022—Decided February 22, 2023&lt;/p&gt;<br>	&lt;p&gt;Kate and David Bartenwerfer decided to remodel the house they jointly owned in San Francisco and to sell it for a profit. David took charge of the project, while Kate remained largely uninvolved. They eventually sold the house to respondent Kieran Buckley. In conjunction with the sale, Kate and David attested that they had disclosed all material facts related to the property. After the purchase, Buckley discovered several defects that the Bartenwerfers had failed to disclose. Buckley sued in California state court and won, leaving the Bartenwerfers jointly responsible for more than $200,000 in damages. Unable to pay that judgment or their other creditors, the Bartenwerfers filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Buckley then filed an adversary complaint in the bankruptcy proceeding, alleging that the debt owed him on the state-court judgment was nondischargeable under the Bankruptcy Code’s exception to discharge of “any debt . . . for money . . . to the extent obtained by . . . false pretenses, a false representation, or actual fraud.” 11 U. S. C. §523(a)(2)(A). The Bankruptcy Court found that David had committed fraud and imputed his fraudulent intent to Kate because the two had formed a legal partnership to renovate and sell the property. The Bankruptcy Appellate Panel disagreed as to Kate’s culpability, holding that §523(a)(2)(A) barred her from discharging the debt only if she knew or had reason to know of David’s fraud. On remand, the Bankruptcy Court determined that Kate lacked such knowledge and could therefore discharge her debt to Buckley. The Bankruptcy Appellate Panel affirmed. The Ninth Circuit reversed in relevant part. Invoking Strang v. Bradner, 114 U. S. 555, the court held that a debtor who is liable for her partner’s fraud cannot discharge that debt in bankruptcy, regardless of her own culpability.&lt;/p&gt;</div>
